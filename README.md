# geospatial-voxels
geospatial-voxels is a repository for doscumenting our voxelization algorithms for point clouds, curves and surfaces. 
The algorithms for voxelization of curves and surfaces are based on the topological voxelization approach of Samuli Laine. 
Algorithms implemented by Pirouz Nourian, researcher @ TU Delft, Urbansim, 3D Geoinofrmation research group. 
C++ and C versions have been implemnted by Ken Arroyo Ahori (researcher @ TU Delft, Urbansim, 3D Geoinofrmation research group)
and Romulo Goncalves (E Science researcher @ Nethelrands eScience Centre Amsterdam NLeSC).

# geospatial-voxels
geospatial-voxels is a repository for documenting our voxelization algorithms for point clouds, curves and surfaces. 

The algorithms for voxelization of curves and surfaces are based on the topological voxelization approach of Samuli Laine. 

The algorithms were designed by Pirouz Nourian, researcher @ TU Delft, Urbanism and 3D Geo-information research group. 
The C++ and C versions have been conceived by Ken Arroyo Ahori (researcher @ TU Delft, Urbanism, 3D Geo-information research group) and Romulo Goncalves (eScience researcher @ Netherlands eScience Centre Amsterdam NLeSC).

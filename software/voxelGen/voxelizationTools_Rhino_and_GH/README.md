VoxelizationTools for Rhino and Grasshopper (GH)
================================================

The tools are prepared as an 'exemplary' implementation of the C# codes in the repository. They are not optimized. 
To open the files you need to have a Rhino3D license and Grasshopper. For the latter no license is required.

Version:
--------
It is recommended to use Rhino 5 and Grasshopper 0.9.0076.

Instructions:
-------------

To use the tools do the following steps:
# Open the .3dm file in Rhino
# In Rhino, type in the command line "Grasshopper"
# In Grasshopper, open the file with the .gh suffix. 
    ** Note: There are VB.NET and C# implementations of the algorithms inside this GH file. Plus several utility functions also written in C# & VB components. 
# To see the source code of components (only the ones which are programmed) double click on them. 
# You can change the code and connect a panel to their outputs for debugging messages.
